# IRC- Internet Relay Chat
* IRC is an open-source protocol for real-time text messaging and group communication developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in 1988.

* IRC resembles the modern day Discord (Which was actually inspired from IRC).

* IRC became one of the most used messaging system during the late 1990s and early 2000s. However with the advent of new proprietary and centralized messaging platforms IRC has lost most of it's userbase. 

* IRC is still prevalent among open-source and tech enthusiasts and certain other communities.

## Advantages of IRC over other platforms and technologies:
* It's **open-source**. Anybody can self host an IRC server for their community.
* Consumes far **less bandwidth** as compared to other platforms.
* **Privacy**. Generally most public IRC servers do not require registration and allows traffic from Tor.
* Very **low cost** self-hosted communication solution for companies, communities without compromising their privacy by relying on 3rd parties. 
* **Flexibility**. With various available clients, IRC can be accessed from every platform and in every form, even from the command line.

## Commonly used Terms:
* **Server**- On IRC, a server refers to a computer system that runs an IRC server software and provides a platform for users to connect and communicate with each other.
Example: _tantalum.libera.chat:6697_
*  **Network**- On IRC, network refers to a collection of IRC servers that are connected to each other, allowing users to communicate with each other across different servers.
Example: _Libera.Chat, DALnet_.
* **Client**- Clients are the softwares that help the users to connect and communicate with the IRC server. Examples- _irssi (cli), Hexchat(gui)_.
* **Channels**- Channels are rooms within the server dedicated to specific topics starting with a "#" symbol in their names. Example- _#gnu, #linux_.
* **Nick**- Nick is the identifier of an user in the IRC network.
* **DCC**- DCC stands for Direct Client-to-Client. It is an IRC-related sub-protocol that enables peers to interconnect using an IRC server for handshaking in order to exchange files or perform non-relayed chats. Once established, a typical DCC session runs independently from the IRC server.
* **Pastebin**- On IRC you may often need to share snippets of code, error messages, logs etc with other people. Pasting them directly on the chat isn't a good practice. Here comes pastebins where you can upload some text and share it via link. Examples- _bpa.st, privatebin.io_
* **Operators (ops)**- Operators or ops in short, are people within a channel who have special privileges such as kicking, banning, inviting users and changing the topic of the channel.
* **ASL**- ASL stands for "Age, Sex, Location". It's a commonly used abbreviation in the IRC community. You shall keep in mind that sharing such informationn may have negative consequences just like any other platforms.
